# Learning Outcome Attainment Measurement Dashboard

TL;DR -- A website for college professors that automates manual calculation and provides tools to generate reports, charts and bar graphs.

The National Board of Accreditation(NBA) requires every college to have a Mission and a Vision. Inorder to get accreditated, the colleges have to show how much of their Vision and Mission they have achieved. This is done using 'Program Outcomes' and 'Course Outcomes'. 

Program Outcome(PO)- Indicates what a student should know / be able to do after his 4 year program.                                
Course Outcome(CO) - Indicates what a student should know / be able to do after completing the course. For eg. After taking a course on Java, a student should be able to understand and apply Object Oriented Principles in his programs.

POs are calculated using COs and COs are calculated the student's performance in various tools like tests, assignments, quizzes, projects, end semester exams and so on.
Currently, college professors enter marks for all students and manually calculate COs and POs. Also, when NBA comes to the college for inspection, professors generate reports and make charts, bar graphs manually.

We plan to eliminate all the manual calculation of COs and POs and provide professors with tools to generate reports, charts, graphs,etc.
 
This project has been currently discontinued and will not be maintained in the future.
